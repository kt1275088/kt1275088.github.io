ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio:

This is where I share my journey of learning and projects ive made. You'll find various things here:

1. Projects and Skills: I work with different computer languages and tools like Python, JavaScript, Node.js, React, HTML, and CSS. I can do both the fancy front-end stuff and the heavy-duty back-end work, including databases and cloud services.

2. Experiments and Tutorials: I like to try out new ideas and learn from them. You can check out my experiments, and I've made some step-by-step guides (tutorials) to help you learn too.

3. Learning Stuff: Learning is a big part of what I do. I've collected resources like books, articles, and courses that have helped me. You might find them useful too.

So, whether you're a potential boss, a possible teammate, or just curious, feel free to look around and learn with me!
